# Important Tasks

[ ] - Activation Functions do not need Tensors.
[x] - See the shape slice thing (Potentially not worth it for now).
[x] - Maybe it is more straight-forward to define a DynModule and StaticModule (Potentially).
[ ] - Define connectivity function.
[ ] - Create Aliases for the types. Static and Dyn Linear for instance.
[ ] - Find a strategy to do the intercept.
    [ ] - One method for activating each module until the desired one.
